# Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) Poleno Algorithm
The FMI_PJ_2022 algorithm uses a combination of holographic images and fluorescence emission signals to recognize 11 pollen classes (Alnus, Artemisia, Betula, Corylus, Fraxinus, Picea, Pinus, Populus, Quercus, Salix, Urtica) and a separate class of water droplets. The training dataset consisted of 5000 valid events per class, 90% of which is used for training and 10% for validation. The image recognition part of the algorithm originated from the model proposed by Eric Sauvageat and co-authors (2020), which in turn is based on the VGG16 architecture by Simonyan and Zisserman (2014). It uses the TensorFlow/Keras open-source software library (Chollet et al., 2015) in a Python3 environment. The fluorescence signal is used to filter out false positives in image recognition by comparing relative spectra.
